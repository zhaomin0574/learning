How To Set Up a Remote Desktop with X2Go on Ubuntu 20.04

Prerequisites(Before starting this tutorial, youâ€™ll need:)
1. An Ubuntu 20.04 x64 instance with 2GB of RAM or more. 2GB is minimal, but a server with 4GB or more is ideal if you have memory-hungry applications that you plan to run. You can use a DigitalOcean Droplet if you like.
2. A user with sudo privileges and an SSH key. Follow this guide to get started: Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 20.04. Make sure you complete Step 4 and configure your firewall to restrict all connections except for OpenSSH.
